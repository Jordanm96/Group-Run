# Project Overview

## Project Name
Group-Run


## Project Description
Group-Run is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to enter in and keep track of their runs/jogs. The homepage will list out all the runs that have been submitted via form. It will have a section that leads the user to the form where they may enter in their run information including: the date, location, distance, speed, calories burned and an emoji ranking system that will let them rate how easy/fun/challenging a specific run was. Each entry will be tracked on the homepage so the user can view their progress. They will also be able to edit/delete any workouts they submit as well.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I have a pretty good understanding of how to use CRUD and seperate out my Components.

### Weaknesses: I am not sure exactly how I want my project to look at the moment. I hope to create a solid wireframe initially but may have to make some changes based on the different Media Queries.

### Opportunities: I will be able to demonstrate my knowledge of using React to create Apps within just the first couple days of project week. As someone who tries to run almost every day, I am excited to be able to log and keep track of all of my personal runs so I can monitor my improvement and progression.

### Threats: This will be the first time starting with a mobile-first style so I will have to get used to looking at a smaller screen before I create styles for bigger screens.
